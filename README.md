# Minecraft Wii U Mod Injector Installer
The setup installer for the Minecraft: Wii U Mod Injector

# What's different from downloading the normal Mod Injector?
Nothing much really, the installer lets you create a shortcut on the Desktop for easy access, though.

# Does this replace the Updater?
No. Althought this can be used as an updater, the Mod Injector will always use the Updater to update itself.
